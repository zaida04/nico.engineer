# `nico.engineer`

This is a blog for my ramblings and thoughts. I write about all sorts of things, ranging from life, to code, to exercise. Read, or don't, the stories will always be there waiting for you.

The blog is created using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind**. It's deployed using **Vercel**.
